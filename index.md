## Welcome to my NetSec Blog

I've been meaning to create one for a while to assist me in my studies, and for the longest time thought I would have to spend money on it. Luckily, GitHub pages came to my rescue!

Throughout this blog there will be the semi-coherent ramblings of a Cyber Operations student attempting to continue his education inside and outside of school. Be patient with my markdown skills, as I'm just getting used to all of this!

### What I've been doing recently, and will continue to do in the future

You should expect some pretty consistent things being posted here, as I'll probably be uploading helpful assignments, labs, and more as I run across them. I'll attempt to include in-depth explanations with as much as possible, but sometimes all that'll pop up will be a study guide with a course number. On the otherhand though, there might be a full write up on a compromised virtual machine... who knows!

Here is a quick list of some of the things I am most likely going to be writing about and continuing to learn about:
- Basic IT Infrastructure
- Network Security
- Vulnerable Machine Walkthroughs
- Software/Hardware Setup Discussions
- And anything else NetSec or Tech that may be of interest

I hope someone finds this useful at least, like I have found so many others!
